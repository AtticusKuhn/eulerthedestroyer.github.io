{"pageProps":{"rawText":"While typescript is well loved among JS developed, as seen by the stack overflow developer survey, it is actually a controversial language. There seems to be a minority of J developers that dislike TS. I would know because I used to be one of them. I used to hate typescript back when I was learning typescript, but now I love it. I think I have figured out why typescript is loved by some and hated by others: functional programming. In essence, typescript only makes sense in functional programming. Reflecting on my first experience with typescript, I disliked it because I tried to plug it into an existing jss project, and it broke everything. Typescript refused to compile code which I considered fine and did not let me write code the way I wanted to. I know realise this was due to my imperative and impure style of programming at the time, which typescript was incompatible with. Now, after learning haskell, I used typescript again, and my new complaint of typescript is that it&#39;s not restrictive enough. When I write my javascript like haskell, typescript meshes beautifully, and I feel I am writing in haskell again. So to the minority of those programmers who are resistant to using typescript, I encourage you to first learn haskell to become good at functional programming.
